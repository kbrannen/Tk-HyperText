Revision history for Perl extension Tk::HyperText.

  0.06 July 14, 2008
  - The module uses HTML::TokeParser now and does "real" HTML parsing.
  - Badly broke backwards compatibility.

  0.05 July 11, 2007
  - Added support for "tag permissions", so that you can allow/deny specific tags from
    being rendered (i.e. say you're making a chat client which uses HTML and you don't
    want people inserting images into their messages, or style sheets, etc)
  - Added the tags <address>, <var>, <cite>, and <def>.
  - Added the <hr> tag.
  - Added two "default images" that are displayed when an <img> tag tries to show
    an image that couldn't be found, or was found but is a file type that isn't
    supported (e.g. <img src="index.html"> would show an "invalid image" icon).
  - Bug fix: every opened tag that modifies your style will now copy all the other
    stacks. As a result, opening <font back="yellow">, then <font color="red">, and
    then closing the red font, will still apply the yellow background to the following
    text. The same is true for every tag.
  - Added some support for Cascading StyleSheets.
  - Added some actual use for the "active link color": it's used as the hover color
    on links (using it as a true active color is mostly useless, since most of the
    time the page won't remain very long when clicking on a link to even see it)

  0.04 June 23, 2007
  - Added support for the <basefont> tag.
  - Added support for <ul>, <ol>, and <li>. I've even extended the HTML specs a
    little and added "diamonds" as a shape for <ul>, and allowed <ul> to specify
    a decimal escape code (<ul type="#0164">)
  - Added a "page history", so that the "visited link color" on pages can actually
    be applied to the links.
  - Fixed the <blockquote> so that the margin applies to the right side as well.

  0.02 June 20, 2007
  - Bugfix: on consecutive insert() commands (without clearing it in between),
    the entire content of the HTML already in the widget would be inserted again,
    in addition to the new content. This has been fixed.

  0.01 June 20, 2007
  - Initial release.
